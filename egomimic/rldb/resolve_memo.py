"""Resolve-once memo scope.

The Zarr DataModule instantiates each dataset config up to three times (train, valid,
norm-stat copy), and each instantiation re-pulls the SQL episode table, the
Scale task list and the path resolution. Inside ``resolve_once()`` those are
computed once per key. Outside it nothing is cached, so long-lived processes
(notebooks, eval scripts) always see the current episode set.
