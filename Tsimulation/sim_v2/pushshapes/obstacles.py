"""Static obstacle layouts for PushShapesEnv.

Each level is a list of segments `((x1, y1), (x2, y2))` inside the 512x512
arena. Segments are added to the space's static body as `pymunk.Segment`
shapes. Level 0 is empty; higher levels progressively constrain the routes
the pusher can take.

Level 0 is the empty arena. Levels 1..6 are the edge-wall family, levels
7..10 are wall-anchored L shapes, levels 11..14 are wide gates, and levels
15..18 are four rotations of a floating L copied from the hand-drawn layout,
and 19..22 are middle sticks—two diagonal, one horizontal, and one vertical—
while 27..30 are four open-U rotations with generous gaps (see
:data:`SKETCH_FAMILY_NAMES`).

``scripts/plot_obstacle_levels.py`` renders any range of levels into one
contact sheet and reports, per level, how many connected components the
navigable space breaks into once eroded by the T's clearance. Anything
other than 1 component means part of the arena is sealed off.

    The eye is 162 of clear space across, so the T's 120 AABB fits inside it,

    crossing from one side of an arm to the other means going through the

    flipped, so rotation is what actually buys eight different levels.)
